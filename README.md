# Kotlin Interview Questions and Answers from [FullStack.Cafe](https://www.fullstack.cafe)

Kotlin is immensely practical. It addresses the problems that developers have, and not some guys in the academia. 
So, it has type inference, it has amazing type safety, good collection library, and concurrency library to top it. 
And it's now official - a lot of organisations are migrating their backend applications to Kotlin, 
and this trend is not likely to end soon. Follow along to check the most complete and comprehensive collection 
of the most common and advanced Kotlin Interview Questions every Android developer should know in 2020.

### Q1: How to initialize an array in Kotlin with values? ⭐⭐

**Questions Details:**

In Java an array can be initialized such as:

```java
 int numbers[] = new int[] {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
```

How does Kotlin's array initialization look like?


**Answer:**

```kotlin
val numbers: IntArray = intArrayOf(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
```

### Q2: How to correctly concatenate a String in Kotlin? ⭐⭐

**Answer:**

In Kotlin, you can concatenate 
1. using string interpolation / templates
 ```kotlin
val a = "Hello"
val b = "World"
val c = "$a $b"
 ```
2. using the + / `plus()` operator
 ```kotlin
 val a = "Hello"
 val b = "World" 
 val c = a + b   // same as calling operator function a.plus(b)
 val c = a.plus(b)
 
 print(c)
 ```
3. using the `StringBuilder`
 ```kotlin
 val a = "Hello"
 val b = "World"
 
 val sb = StringBuilder()
 sb.append(a).append(b)
 val c = sb.toString()
 
 print(c)
 ```

### Q3: What is basic difference between fold and reduce in Kotlin? When to use which? ⭐⭐

**Answer:**

* `fold` takes an initial value, and the first invocation of the lambda you pass to it will receive that initial value and the first element of the collection as parameters.

 ```kotlin 
 listOf(1, 2, 3).fold(0) { sum, element -> sum + element }
 ```
 The first call to the lambda will be with parameters `0` and `1`.

 Having the ability to pass in an initial value is useful _if you have to provide some sort of default value or parameter for your operation_.

* `reduce` doesn't take an initial value, but instead starts with the first element of the collection as the accumulator (called `sum` in the following example)

 ```kotlin
 listOf(1, 2, 3).reduce { sum, element -> sum + element }
 ```

 The first call to the lambda here will be with parameters `1` and `2`.

### Q4: What is the idiomatic way to remove duplicate strings from array? ⭐⭐

**Questions Details:**

How to remove duplicates from an `Array<String?>` in Kotlin?


**Answer:**

Use the `distinct` extension function:

```kotlin
val a = arrayOf("a", "a", "b", "c", "c")
val b = a.distinct() // ["a", "b", "c"]
```

You can also use:
* `toSet`, `toMutableSet`
* `toHashSet` - if you don't need the original ordering to be preserved

These functions produce a `Set` instead of a `List` and should be a little bit more efficient than distinct.

### Q5: What is the difference between var and val in Kotlin? ⭐⭐

**Answer:**

* **var** is like `general` variable and it's known as a _mutable_ variable in kotlin and can be assigned multiple times.

* **val** is like `Final` variable and it's known as _immutable_ in Kotlin and can be initialized only single time.

```sh
+----------------+-----------------------------+---------------------------+
|                |             val             |            var            |
+----------------+-----------------------------+---------------------------+
| Reference type | Immutable(once initialized  | Mutable(can able to change|
|                | can't be reassigned)        | value)                    |
+----------------+-----------------------------+---------------------------+
| Example        | val n = 20                  | var n = 20                |
+----------------+-----------------------------+---------------------------+
| In Java        | final int n = 20;           | int n = 20;               |
+----------------+-----------------------------+---------------------------+
```

🔗 **Source:** [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44200075/val-and-var-in-kotlin)


### Q6: Where should I use var and where val? ⭐⭐

**Answer:**

Use **var** where value is changing _frequently_. For example while getting location of android device:

```kotlin
var integerVariable : Int? = null
```

Use **val** where there is _no change_ in value in whole class. For example you want set textview or button's text programmatically.

```kotlin
val stringVariables : String = "Button's Constant or final Text"
```

🔗 **Source:** [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44200075/val-and-var-in-kotlin)


### Q7: What is a data class in Kotlin? ⭐⭐

**Answer:**

We frequently create classes whose main purpose is to hold data. In Kotlin, this is called a data class and is marked as `data`:

```kotlin
data class User(val name: String, val age: Int)
```

To ensure consistency and meaningful behavior of the generated code, data classes have to fulfill the following requirements:

* The primary constructor needs to have at least one parameter;
* All primary constructor parameters need to be marked as val or var;
* Data classes cannot be abstract, open, sealed or inner;

🔗 **Source:** [kotlinlang.org](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/data-classes.html)


### Q8: What is a primary constructor in Kotlin? ⭐⭐

**Answer:**

The **primary constructor** is part of the class header. Unlike Java, you don't need to declare a constructor in the body of the class. Here's an example:

```kotlin
class Person(val firstName: String, var age: Int) {
    // class body
}
```

The main idea is by removing the constructor keyword, our code gets simplified and easy to understand.

### Q9: How to create singleton in Kotlin? ⭐⭐

**Answer:**

Just use `object`.
```kotlin
object SomeSingleton
```
The above Kotlin object will be compiled to the following equivalent Java code:
```java
public final class SomeSingleton {
   public static final SomeSingleton INSTANCE;

   private SomeSingleton() {
      INSTANCE = (SomeSingleton)this;
      System.out.println("init complete");
   }

   static {
      new SomeSingleton();
   }
}
```
This is the preferred way to implement singletons on a JVM because it enables thread-safe lazy initialization without having to rely on a locking algorithm like the complex double-checked locking.

### Q10: What will be result of the following code execution? ⭐⭐⭐

    "Hola"
}

    println(aVar)
